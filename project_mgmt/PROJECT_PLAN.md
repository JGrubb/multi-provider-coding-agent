# Multi-Provider Coding Agent - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A Python-based coding agent that can orchestrate conversations between multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama) with transparent output showing all model interactions, delegations, and reasoning.

One of the main points of this agent is to offload inference compute to local models where performance allows. Therefore, one of the critical implementation details is the ability to retrieve performance profiling information from the Ollama model after it runs. The frontier model - Claude et al - should use this information iteratively to better understand how to craft queries that can run in a reasonably performant manner locally. This is the experimental side of this agent.

Another marquee feature is capability to have various models communicate with each other to compare and refine approaches before implementing. These conversations are printed back to the human in the REPL so that we can stay in the loop of the thought process.

## Key Objectives
1. **Performance-Driven Local Inference**: Offload compute to local models where performance allows
2. **Iterative Query Optimization**: Use performance data to improve local model queries over time
3. **Multi-Model Conversations**: Enable models to collaborate and deliberate before implementation
4. **Transparent REPL Experience**: Show all model interactions and decision-making processes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Ollama performance metrics accurately captured and stored
- [ ] Claude successfully optimizes queries based on performance data
- [ ] Multi-model conversations visible in REPL with full transparency
- [ ] System routes tasks intelligently based on performance profiles
- [ ] Performance improves iteratively over time through learning

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **LLM SDKs**: anthropic, google-generativeai, requests (Ollama)
