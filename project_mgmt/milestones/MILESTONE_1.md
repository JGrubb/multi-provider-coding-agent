# Milestone 1: Performance Monitoring Foundation

**Timeline**: Week 1  
**Goal**: Establish performance tracking infrastructure and basic Ollama integration

## Overview
This milestone establishes the foundation for performance-driven local inference by implementing comprehensive performance monitoring for Ollama models and creating the basic agent framework.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Ollama provider captures detailed performance metrics
- [ ] Performance data is reliably stored and retrievable
- [ ] Basic agent can orchestrate Ollama calls with performance tracking
- [ ] Local models can execute essential coding tools (read, write, edit, search files)
- [ ] Tool usage is tracked in performance metrics
- [ ] CLI interface allows manual testing of all features
- [ ] Performance metrics are accurate and comprehensive

## Dependencies
- Ollama running locally
- Python environment set up
- SQLite available

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Ollama API might not provide all needed metrics
- **Mitigation**: Implement system-level monitoring as fallback

## Deliverables
1. Performance metrics data structures and models
2. Enhanced Ollama provider with comprehensive profiling
3. SQLite database schema for performance data storage
4. Basic agent framework with metric collection
5. Essential coding tools for local model interaction
6. Simple CLI for testing and validation
